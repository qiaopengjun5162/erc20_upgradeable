# erc20_upgradeable

This is a simple ERC20 token contract that is upgradeable. It is written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

The contract is upgradeable because it uses the OpenZeppelin library to implement the ERC20 standard and the upgradeable contract pattern. This allows the contract to be upgraded without losing its state or breaking its functionality.
